      <p>This program acts as a stopwatch for the amount of time spent to type a passage from a novel. It opens a GUI in another tab.</p>

          <h3>How it works </h3>

<p> We provided a quote from a book in a GUI. Here we used Tkinter and Timeit for GUI and typing speed, respectively. First, we imported all the libraries mentioned above and created a speed testing window using Tkinter. Next, with Timeit, we recorded the time spent on each provided passage. Then, with a series of strings, we connected these two libraries and made this program as a result. </p> 
    </li>
        <ul>
          <li>When you click the program, a window will pop up.</li>
            <li>Press the <b> begin </b> button to start typing </li>
            <li>Type the top text in the box below. When you are finished typing, press <b> done </b>  </li>
            <li>If you have typed the text incorrectly, it will say <b> Wrong Input </b>. If you have typed it correctly, the number of seconds you spent to type the text will show up. </li>
            <li>If you are not satisfied with your result, you can click <b> try again </b> for a new passage. </li>
        </ul>

<h3>Files </h3>
      <ul>
            <li>final.html (main html file): this file contains the code for the <b> Home </b> page of this website.</li>
            <li>books.html (secondary html file): this file contains the books used for the <b> practice  </b> sections of this program. </li>
            <li>final.css (css file): this file provides all the styling for this webpage.</li>
            <li>typing.py (main python file): this file contains the code of the typing test program.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
</html>

  <h3>Resources </h3>
    <u1>
          <li> Online: Brooks website, Youtube, etc. </li>
         <li> Libraries: Tkinter, Timeit </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</html>
    
  <h3>Bugs </h3>
       <p> Sometimes clicking the <b> try again </b> section will generate a duplicate passage. This is because the randomizer on the program is not fully polished. </p>
  </li>
   <h3>Note </h3>
  <p> We changed our project direction from the Pokemon v. Lion generator, as the files that needed to be downloaded proved to large for our computers to handle. </p>
