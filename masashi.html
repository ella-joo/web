<p>masashi's color studies and use of colored light allows for consistent mood across several pictures, and an ambience unique to color photography. many street photographers choose to use black and white to better utilize contrast, but masashi focuses heavily on color. his color grading seems very natural, and i really like his palettes.</p>
