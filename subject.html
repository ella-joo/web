  <h2>ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 oz white chocolate</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar<li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tbsp matcha</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>directions</h2>
  <p>
  Melt together the butter and the white chocolate, and let it cool. Then mix together the eggs, both sugars, and the vanilla extract, until homogenous. Add the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour and matcha into the bowl, and add the salt. Bake for 30-40 mins at 350 degrees Farenheit. Let it cool for 30 minutes. Eat it I guess.

  <h2>moral takeaway<h2>
  <p>
  Hopefully this has been an educational process for anyone reading. Morally, me making this was a bit flawed, as I didn't come up with the recipe, but I'm not using this for profit so does it matter? I say no. Go make the brownies and send some to me.
